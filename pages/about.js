          Hello, everyone âœ‹ I&apos;m a software developer living in Bangalore, India. I love to build and design
          things. I have experience in creating cross-platform desktop applications, website backends, user experience,
          and visual design. I have worked extensively in teams and alone.

          WTF? Sound human Koushith. Okay, here you go. Huh, so you&apos;re interested in knowing more about me? The
          first thing I should mention that I don&apos;t have any unique talents. I consider myself pretty average.

          <h3>My two life principles are: </h3>
          <div className='principles'>
            <li> Don&apos;t give up. </li>
            <li> Work really hard in the right direction. </li>

          That&apos;s how I have achieved whatever you see so far. Born in a small Village in Kodagu also known as
          (Coorg- Scotland of India), I have humble beginnings. Until 2016, the only thing I knew about computers was
          that it was invented by a guy named Charles or something..From there, I have taught myself everything.
          I&apos;m still learning. I still have to Google the basic stuff like adding inline CSS in HTML :p.
